📢 𝗖𝗲𝗹𝗲𝗯𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗚𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗳𝘂𝗹 𝗝𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗻𝗲𝘆: 𝗦𝗤𝗟 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻!



💻 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄:

I recently completed an exciting 𝗦𝗤𝗟 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁. 

1️⃣ 𝗗𝗼𝗺𝗮𝗶𝗻:- 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘀𝘂𝗺𝗲𝗿 𝗚𝗼𝗼𝗱𝘀

2️⃣ 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗻𝘆 :- 𝗔𝘁𝗹𝗶𝗤 𝗛𝗮𝗿𝗱𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗲

3️⃣ 𝗚𝗼𝗮𝗹 :- 𝟭𝟬 𝗔𝗱-𝗛𝗼𝗰-𝗜𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁𝘀

The goal was to uncover 𝟭𝟬 𝗮𝗱-𝗵𝗼𝗰 𝗶𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁𝘀 that could help the management make quick and smart data-informed decisions.



🚀 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗻𝗴𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴𝘀:

The project was inspired by the 𝗖𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗯𝗮𝘀𝗶𝗰𝘀 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝘂𝗺𝗲 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗻𝗴𝗲 - 𝟰, which focused on SQL skill assessment for real-world business scenarios. I worked on queries involving:



𝗕𝗮𝘀𝗶𝗰 𝘁𝗼 𝗔𝗱𝘃𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗱 𝗦𝗤𝗟 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗽𝘁𝘀: SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY, LIMIT, and CASE.

𝗔𝗱𝘃𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗱 𝗧𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗶𝗾𝘂𝗲𝘀: CTEs, Window Functions (OVER(), DENSE_RANK), Subqueries, and Joins.

This project gave me hands-on experience in writing efficient queries from scratch to an advanced level.



📊 𝗧𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀 𝗨𝘀𝗲𝗱:

𝗠𝘆𝗦𝗤𝗟: For running queries and analyzing the data.

𝗣𝗼𝘄𝗲𝗿 𝗕𝗜: To create stunning visualizations and present actionable insights to the management.



🏢 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗻𝘆 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺:

👁️‍🗨️ The management at AtliQ Hardware faced challenges due to a lack of actionable insights, which hindered their ability to make quick and smart decisions.
